# 2017-2018 EMG HMI
A senior project conducted by Jim Ramsay and Aditya Patel, advised by Dr. Yufeng Lu and Dr. In Soo Ahn. 

Sponsored by Bradley University,
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering 

## Abstract
Surface Electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive technique which records the electrical activity of muscles through electrodes 
placed directly on the arm. This project aims to develop an EMG-based control system. A Myo Armband, containing eight electrode 
pairs, wirelessly transmits EMG data to a central controller, which runs conditional logic functions to identify three different 
user hand gestures. The commands are used to remotely pan individual cameras and select from multiple video feeds. Our study 
demonstrates that EMG-based gesture control is a viable human machine interface option for a variety of applications in the 
industrial, medical, and consumer markets.
